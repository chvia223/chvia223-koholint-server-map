# Overview

This is a website project for a Bedrock Minecraft server I've been playing on for a long time. I've always wanted something similar to the existing Dynamap plugin that can be found for Java Minecraft servers, but couldn't find anything for Bedrock edition, especially for a Realms server. This won't have all of the functionality of Dynamap, but will have some key features that I've been wanting.

# Short Term Goals
World Map:
* Show region borders
* Show base locations along with owners and coordinates
* Show main roads between regions
* Show main railways between regions

Regional Maps:
* Have more localized maps for each region with more specified details
* A zoom in/zoom out feature

# Long Term Goals
* Hosting website locally on a raspberry pi so I can connect all of the information to a backend database
* Potentially using a Javascript framework like React or Node.js to assist in the continuing functionality of this project
* Potentially connecting with an API to get the map updated automatically when there are changes within the world. (Not sure if this is even do-able, but if it is then I will try to package this project in a way that other server owners/maintainers can implement it into their own servers)


# Development Environment

* HTML 5
* CSS
